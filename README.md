xkcd Password Generator

Live URL:


Description:

A simple utility for generating xkcd style passwords. It allows you to modify the ability to adding special characters, lower case, upper case, and numbers to add to the complexity of the password.

Details for teaching team:

I initially misread/misinterpreted some of the instructions for this project and initially wrote a script that creates a password that is not pronounceable. Once I modified it I didnâ€™t have a chance to add any stylistic design to the site so though it functions properly, it looks awful.


Outside code:

None, though I would have liked to have used Bootstrap for CSS templates and a word list to add to the complexity of the word reservoir portion of the code.
